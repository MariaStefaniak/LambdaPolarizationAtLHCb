README - Lambda Polarization & Toroidal Vorticity Analysis
============================================================

This folder contains the PbPb and SMOG analysis for the 2024 data,
based on two distinct Analysis Productions.

The main objective of this analysis is to determine the transverse
polarization of the Lambda hyperon, with a special focus on possible
signatures of Toroidal Vorticity in heavy-ion collisions.

Each subfolder and macro is accompanied by its own README file,
where you will find all necessary details regarding setup, execution,
and output of the analysis scripts.

Important Notes & Acknowledgements
---------------------------------------

This analysis framework was developed by Maria Stefaniak, with
tremendous support and mentorship from Prof. Mike Lisa (The Ohio State
University). Although I have now begun a new chapter in my scientific
career, I remain more than happy to assist anyone interested in 
continuing this project and helping bring it to publication.

While I have done my best to ensure quality and consistency, please
be aware that:

→ This code and its results have **not** been officially validated
   by the LHCb collaboration or the OSU group.
→ There may be mistakes—either in the code logic, physical 
   interpretation, or documentation.
→ You are strongly encouraged to revalidate everything from the
   beginning before using this work in any official capacity.

Get in Touch
---------------------------------------

If you decide to use this code for your own studies, please let me know!
I would love to hear how it's being used, and am rooting for your success.
This is genuinely cool science, and I hope you can bring it across 
the finish line—even if I could not.

Sometimes in life we make difficult decisions, believing they are the
right ones for ourselves and those closest to us. I wish you the very
best of luck with your analysis and future scientific endeavors!

With gratitude and excitement for what comes next,
– Maria :)
